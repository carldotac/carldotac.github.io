** TODO The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth
Afterbirth, Afterbirth+, Repentance
4/5
** TODO BioShock
5/5
** TODO BioShock 2
3/5
** TODO BioShock: Infinite
5/5
** TODO Cave Story
5/5
** DONE Celeste
The absolute best 2D platforming has to offer. Tough as nails, but never frustrating thanks to quick respawns and per-screen checkpoints. Beautifully integrates a touching story with its gameplay.

5/5
** DONE Control
While its sense of humor is appreciated and the "launch" telekinetic power (think Half-Life 2's gravity gun, minus the gun) is a treat, Control's story loses its luster once it becomes obvious that there isn't actually anything grand going on, it's just basically [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation][SCP Foundation]] vignettes. Overstays its welcome with the story expansions.

3/5
** TODO Disco Elysium


5/5
** TODO Dishonored 2
3/5
** DONE Dishonored: Death of the Outsider
This really should be worse than Dishonored 2, but the ability to kill without consequence and the recharging mana system make the minute-to-minute gameplay so much better than its immediate predecessor.

4/5
** TODO DOOM (2016)
5/5
** TODO DOOM: Eternal
** TODO Enter the Gungeon
** TODO Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia
** DONE Hades
Beautifully woven story/gameplay interaction. While a great game, it's a roguelike for people who don't like roguelikes. And as a fan of the genre, it lacks the staying power of something like The Binding of Isaac. Would love to see an expansion to add some replayability, and the difficulty progression really could have benefited from allowing rewards for increasing the level by more than 1 at a time. I'm nitpicking because I love it.

5/5
** TODO Halo
** TODO Halo 2
** TODO Halo 3
** TODO Halo 3: ODST
** TODO Halo 4
** TODO Halo: Reach
** TODO The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword
** DONE Mass Effect
The black sheep of the series for its clunky combat, the original Mass Effect nevertheless has the best worldbuilding and story of them all.

4/5
** DONE Mass Effect 2
Well written, deeply emotional, and featuring actually competent gunplay. BioWare's finest outing.

5/5
** DONE Mass Effect 3
The price of Mass Effect 2 spending its time on what amount to sidequests to develop its cast is that Mass Effect 3's story has entirely too much ground to cover. The unsatisfying ending cannot take away from the dozens of hours preceding it in video gaming's finest space epic.

4/5
** DONE Middle Earth: Shadow of War
A mechanically competent but utterly forgettable modern open world (and I do not use those three words positively) adventure. 

3/5
** TODO New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe
** DONE Pikmin 3 Deluxe
(Played entirely in coop mode.) Enjoyable light RTS/action/puzzler that unfortunately ends with a supremely unsatisfying difficulty spike.

3/5
** DONE Pillars of Eternity
It's clear that Obsidian put extraordinary effort into building the world of Eora, but the entire game is an overwhelming exposition dump. This is not a recipe for a compelling story-and-character-heavy RPG, and the plodding combat is unforgivable.

2/5
** DONE Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire
A remarkable turnaround after the original. Better combat AI and lower difficulty make the game flow better, and the writing, voice acting, and presentation are all a big step up. As close as we'll ever get to DnD Pirates: The Video Game.

4/5
** TODO Sid Meier's Civilization VI
Gathering Storm, Rising Tide
** TODO Skate 3
** DONE Sonic Mania
The platonic ideal Sonic game, with delightful throwback graphics and soundtrack with top-notch level design. Unfortunately, the Sonic formula is fundamentally flawed. The game wants you to fly through levels, but without replaying and memorizing levels, the gameplay is either effectively an autoscroller or failing to go fast by hitting obstacles or falling.

4/5
** DONE SUPERHOT
Ostensibly a shooter, but the central conceit of a shooter where time only passes when you move ends up making it more of a puzzler. The story gets in the way a bit and is nowhere close to as clever as it thinks it is. Completely superseded by its VR version.

3/5
** DONE SUPERHOT VR
It's /The Matrix/ in a game, with the immediacy and intuitiveness afford by VR. By far, the coolest I have ever felt while playing a video game. ("Felt" is doing a lot of work in that sentence. I've seen video of me playing.)

5/5
** DONE SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE
A roguelike SUPERHOT is a great concept, but the lack of content and amount of replaying levels necessary upon failure made me lose interest.

2/5
** DONE Undertale
If art is anything that evokes an emotional response, then Undertale is a shining example of games as art. A personal favorite.

5/5
** DONE Yooka-Laylee
What if we took Banjo-Kazooie and removed the tight level design for vast, barren worlds? The version I played at launch was buggy and had a camera that was downright hostile to the player.

2/5
