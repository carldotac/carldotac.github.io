<p>
I use <a href="https://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> on the desktop.
Although most of my userland operations are done in Emacs and Firefox, I tend to appreciate the choice when handling tasks more complex than text-based processes.
KWin, the default window manager, features a superb set of per-application rules that come in handy while playing games, like forcing borderless fullscreen or always keeping a window on top.
Plasma is stuffed to the brim with features and hooks, and I've exploited them before when writing <a href="https://github.com/carldotac/kdeconnect.el">my first Emacs package</a> to ease certain operations between Emacs and my mobile devices.
But one feature I've always missed has been desktop search.
KDE offers the excellent <a href="https://github.com/KDE/baloo">Baloo</a>, a file indexer that handles both metadata and content, and its integration with <a href="https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Krunner">Krunner</a> is the main reason I use the latter.
As a matter of fact, despite Krunner's many features, like arithmetic and dictionary lookups, I only ever use it for finding files and launching applications.
I can improve this workflow.
</p>

<p>
When opening a file, Krunner launches a new instance of the filetype's default program.
This is sensible.
If I open a PDF, I probably want Okular, and if I need to check an old web page, Firefox is the appropriate tool.
But if I'm working in Emacs, there's tremendous value to staying in Emacs.
Further, instead of opening a new instance of Emacs for text files, a within-Emacs solution lets me simply visit the file in a new buffer.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
As the piece de resistance, I get to use <a href="http://oremacs.com/2015/04/09/counsel-completion/">Counsel</a> for completion instead of Krunner.

As I discovered when writing kdeconnect.el, Emacs and Emacs Lisp make for an interesting programming experience.
Unlike Java's extensive libraries and Python's convenience, writing Emacs Lisp makes me yearn for quality of life functions.
Fortunately, the code to use Baloo for file searches form Emacs is basic enough that Emacs <i>does</i> abstract away much of the nitty gritty.
Some of these functions I already knew (<code>completing-read</code> to let Emacs handle completion, <code>split-string</code> to take shell output and make a list, <code>mapconcat</code> and <code>shell-quote-argument</code> to generate safe shell commands), but others were novel to me and a massive relief to discover in the docs, like <code>butlast</code> to remove the last line of output, which contains the search's time to execute, or <code>safe-length-query</code> to check if a list is empty.
Here's the resulting code:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #51afef; font-weight: bold;">defun</span> <span style="color: #c678dd; font-weight: bold;">baloo-search</span> (query)
  <span style="color: #83898d;">"Search for files matching QUERY using Baloo."</span>
  (<span style="color: #51afef; font-weight: bold;">interactive</span> <span style="color: #98be65;">"MSearch: "</span>)
  (<span style="color: #51afef; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> query (butlast
               (split-string
                (shell-command-to-string
                 (mapconcat 'identity
                            (list <span style="color: #98be65;">"baloosearch"</span>(shell-quote-argument query))
                            <span style="color: #98be65;">" "</span>)) <span style="color: #98be65;">"\n"</span> t) 1))
  (<span style="color: #51afef; font-weight: bold;">if</span> (eq (safe-length query) 0)
      (<span style="color: #dc752f; background-color: #292b2e;">error</span> <span style="color: #98be65;">"No matches"</span>))
  (find-file (completing-read
              <span style="color: #98be65;">"Select file: "</span>
              query
              nil t <span style="color: #98be65;">""</span>)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Pop that in your <code>init.el</code> or evaluate it somewhere and you're good to go!
Call <code>M-x baloo-search</code>, enter your search term(s), which can include an extension, and choose your file.
I've found this to be incredibly useful when I don't know quite where a file is or what it's called, and perhaps you will too.
