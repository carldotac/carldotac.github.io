<h2 id="orgf081282">007: Nightfire</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf081282">
<p>
The single-player campaign is surprisingly deep thanks to challenges, some open levels, and plenty of weapons, but the package is rounded out by a great multiplayer mode with AI bots, a rarity at the time.

<h2 id="orgf769cb5">Advance Wars</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf769cb5">
<p>
While surpassed by its sequels, it's still a fantastically accessible tactical game offering a trifecta of a cute campaign, endlessly replayable multiplayer, and "war room" missions. War has never been this adorable.

<h2 id="orga9de3e5">Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga9de3e5">
<p>
Everything great about <i>Advance Wars</i> turned up. A better and more varied campaign, more COs, more maps, more terrain, and one new unit, the unnecessary Neotank. One of the GBA's greatest.

<h2 id="org5906950">Advance Wars: Days of Ruin</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5906950">
<p>
Even more stuff than <i>Black Hole Rising</i>! Sure, the new units are terribly balanced and situational and the new COs aren't great, but everything from before is here. The hard mode campaign is completely broken, but the freedom to choose your COs and abilities means that you're even more busted, allowing for some fun puzzle-y battles where prior strategizing is more important than usual.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org57b1266">
<p>
It's better balanced than prior games in the series, though the grittiness is just bland and the final mission is brutal and unfun. But the heart of <i>Advance Wars</i> remains, which is what matters most.

The best retro 3D platformer in a while, sure to satisfy fans yearning for something in the <i>Super Mario Sunshine</i> vein. Lives up to its "cute as heck" billing.

<p>
I put a lot of time into <i>Altitude</i>, a 2D plane combat game, especially "ball" mode, which was essentially plane rugby/soccer. Pleasing movement and combat with a high skill ceiling and multiple loadouts for depth.

<p>
If it were free, people would still be playing this. Instead, it's a dead game. Drafting was a delight, constructed was pay-to-win, much like Richard Garfield's most famous card game. Made good use of the digital space with its mechanics, and I would have loved to have seen what they had for future card sets. Some very frustrating randomness.

I do not enjoy sitting on benches in a very pretty rendition of the Middle East. Where are all the assassinations? What's with the modern-day segments? (A question I'm told is still asked about the other 20ish games.)

Boy do I wish more games were written at a level that assumes a working knowledge of Objectivism. I'm here for the art design, the writing, and the rare ludonarrative concordance in a AAA game; the shooting mechanics are unremarkable by today's standards.

<h2 id="org8663d40">Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8663d40">
<p>
How spoiled we were in 2007 to have had this and <i>Halo 3</i> drop within a few weeks of each other. The campaign was unrelenting action, filled with set pieces and levels; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Ghillied_Up">"All Ghillied Up"</a> has its own Wikipedia page, for crying out loud. The multiplayer took that relentlessness even further with its fast time-to-kill, and it was a masterclass in player engagement. Before the industry switched over to Skinner boxes and pay-to-win monetization, <i>COD4</i> had a constant drip of weapons and challenges, with the hamster wheel prestige system. Everything was done to excite our monkey brains, especially that little crosshair that would come up when hitting an opponent. This was a game that felt <i>good</i> to play.

<p>
Once upon a time, licensed platformers were everywhere, and back in the late 80s and early 90s, many weren't half-bad. <i>Castle of Illusion</i> stands out thanks to its all-over-the-place level themes and solid bounce-based platforming, a core revisited later by games like <i>Shovel Knight</i>.

The original indie labor of love that paved the way for so many others. The tight movement/combat is enough, but it's a charming story and a truly outstanding score (I prefer the original compositions over the remixes, but the graphical updates are an improvement).

While its sense of humor is appreciated and the "launch" telekinetic power (think Half-Life 2's gravity gun, minus the gun) is a treat, Control's story loses its luster once it becomes obvious that there isn't actually anything grand going on, it's just basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation">SCP Foundation</a> vignettes. Overstays its welcome with the story expansions.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1426c88">
<p>
On the one hand, it's basically a superhuman open world playground with powerful abilities, weapons, and vehicles. On the other, the actual missions suffer when the optimal approach changes from heist-like planning to jumping around, killing everyone, and hiding when your shields wear off. That playground is pretty great, though.

The open map and powers are great for replay, and it still looks good enough to impress, especially the second level. I'm feeling old as I remember getting my first GPU that could run this: a GTX 260 216 core. And I played on a 1680x1050 monitor. On Windows Vista.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf676ce9">
<p>
A worse version of <i>Dark Souls</i>, especially with the lack of the bonfire system. An egregious incident that stands out is backing away from a dangerous enemy to heal, only to exit lock-on range and have my character turn around and die instantly to a ranged attack I would have blocked with my shield just moments ago. "That's <i>Souls</i> games for you!" someone on the Internet gleefully exclaims. But with a job and other games to play I find that I, much like Mr. Bond, have no time to die. I'll note that the key difference between this and the other FromSoftware game I bounced off of, <i>Sekiro</i>, is that I made real progress in <i>Demon's Souls</i> and could have beaten it if I wanted to spend the time, but the time lost due to unfair deaths wasn't worth it, while in <i>Sekiro</i> I was incapable of getting any further when I decided very early on that it wasn't for me.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org52329c0">
<p>
I want to love it for the imaginative level design and powers, but the game doesn't want me to love it. There are two main issues. First, most of the game's powers are novel ways to kill, but the game's morality system will tell you how awful you are if you avail yourself of them. Second, the mana system encourages the player to use their powers sparingly. (Incentives matter, people.) The result was crouching through the world, teleporting, waiting for the mana to recharge from that teleport, and repeating, quickloading whenever I was caught. This is a boring, slow way to play that the game encourages, rather than playing up its strengths.

Suffers very hard from a need to be bigger than its predecessor. Too many interconnecting systems and actions create an overwhelming game with exactly one way to play. I had a much better time dropping the difficulty from Ultra-Violence to Hurt Me Plenty and ignoring much of it. And why is there so much platforming in a game about murdering demons as ruthlessly as possible?

I am unsurprised that a handheld touch-based rhythm game with a nonsensical comic book story about secret agent cheerleaders helping everyday people score dates, defeat monsters, and save Christmas set to a licensed soundtrack of covers sold so poorly. But for those who enjoy the camp, it's a fun rhythm novelty. The spinners destroyed my DS' touch screen. Reminds me of the mini games in the original <i>Mario Party</i> that destroyed joysticks and palms. Nintendo should just never have rotation mechanics, I guess.

My introduction to the series, and still my favorite. A genuinely engaging story that stands on its own while setting up its sequel. Varied level design as well. Unit balance is poor, with Laguz being useless and paladins being grossly overpowered, and enemy phases are much too slow. But it's the writing that sets it apart. Characters all get time to exist as more than a set of stats with an equipped weapon, and the localization team actually made a character speak in iambic pentameter, which is a pretty bonkers amount of effort.

The school setting allows the player time and reason to actually care about the characters, which makes the inevitable conflict that much more emotionally weighty, so credit there.

10 hours in and I was ready to award it 5/5 as a fantastically executed Metroidvania/Soulslike hybrid with superb controls and presentation. 8.5 hours later, having settled for the bad ending, I can't. I have patience for certain difficult games, such as <i>Celeste</i> and <i>Super Meat Boy</i>, but those games almost universally feature instant retries without penalty. <i>Hollow Knight</i> is an absolute slog towards the end, not necessarily due to the difficulty of any of its mandatory bosses (I don't think I died more than thrice on anything required), but because of the amount of downtime. Fast travel is limited, and this led to many situations of fast traveling, walking a minute to the bank, walking back, fast traveling somewhere else, buying something, walking to another vendor, finding out I needed more geo, going back to the bank&#x2026; Or the situations where I die to a boss and have to redo trivial (but slow!) platforming challenges and basic baddies to get back to the boss only to die again. Or my personal favorite, the optional <i>Super Meat Boy</i> spinning saws platformer area where your health is supposed to be a scary limitation for the platforming gauntlet, but I had equipped the charm where your last pip of damage slowly recovers, and so every death meant 30 seconds of looking at my phone instead of playing the game. These are fundamental design problems, and they're frustratingly solvable. Upon discovery that the good ending was locked behind a super boss that requires beating the normal final boss prior to every attempt, I completely lost interest. Which is a shame, because there's a phenomenal game in here.

Stressed during my senior year of college, I decided that I'd try to complete the National Pokédex in <i>Omega Ruby</i>. Armed with <a href="https://serebii.net/">Serebii.net</a> and some elaborate spreadsheeting, I saw that between <i>Omega Ruby</i>, my ancient copy of <i>Diamond</i> and more recent <i>X</i>, all I needed was <i>Black</i> to get everything. This required driving out to a GameStop for a disappointingly expensive <i>Black</i> and borrowing another DS to facilitate transferring Pokémon from generation IV (some of whom had already come from III!) into VI. And it was fantastic in a compulsive, completionist sort of way. ORAS are bright and joyful, if somewhat pedestrian for the series, but generation VI was also an impressive culmination of catch 'em all ethos thanks to the many transfer and trade mechanisms.

The platonic ideal Sonic game, with delightful throwback graphics and soundtrack with top-notch level design. Unfortunately, the Sonic formula is fundamentally flawed. The game wants you to fly through levels, but without replaying and memorizing levels, the gameplay is either effectively an autoscroller or failing to go fast by hitting obstacles or falling.

I can recognize <i>Super Metroid</i> as a genre-defining game.

The controls are terrible and Samus' movement is slow and clunky. What it gets right are a constant sense of progression and its atmosphere, especially <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9ieYLHc1fQ">the music</a>. The one silver lining of a first playthrough in 2021 is that even the built-in Switch emulator supports save stats to make things less frustrating.

The story mode was oddly high budget, but the slower pace as a concession to the Wii's poor online is too steep a price. Also, tripping?

Charming derivative of the beloved <i>Advance Wars</i> series. Turns out that's not an amazing formula in a world where <i>XCOM</i> exists.

There's no reason to go back when <i>Wii Sports Resort</i> exists (unless you really like the baseball or boxing games), but this game rocked the world, exposing millions of people to video games. Everyone loved that bowling game. Everyone.

It's a dated tech demo in a world with today's VR systems, and yet it was an easy multiplayer hit with casuals. Nintendo didn't have to put as much love into its world (there's a whole island, and every event takes place somewhere on it in a cohesive world!) or Mii integration, but they did. Surprising depth to some of the games like golf and bowling.

It takes <i>Enemy Unknown</i>, improves the good parts, and strips out as much of the boring strategic layer as it can. My favorite turn-based tactics game of all time. Huge replayability thanks to the randomized levels, soldiers, and enemies (the latter in the <i>War of the Chosen</i> expansion, which is vital). I live for those turns where the game becomes a challenge to somehow kill all the enemies, or even just survive, and it delivers in spades. Main weakness is the reverse difficulty curve.

While it loses the depth of <i>XCOM 2</i>, there's some good tactical puzzle action to be had here, the changes to the formula are enough of a novelty for its runtime.

Completely outclassed by <i>XCOM 2</i>, but it was a revelation coming from Fire Emblem to get to play with destructable environments and line of sight. Improved by the <i>Enemy Within</i> expansion's nudges to avoid turtling.

I played this during the first year of my PhD, perhaps the last time I'll be willing to put up with an unnecessarily long JRPG. But the combat system is a treat, the score is one of my favorites, and the I was in the right mindstate for an inconsequential shonen story.

What if we took Banjo-Kazooie and removed the tight level design for vast, barren worlds? The version I played at launch was buggy and had a camera that was downright hostile to the player.
