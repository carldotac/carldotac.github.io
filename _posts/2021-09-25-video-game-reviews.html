<h2 id="org9c5aab1">007: Nightfire</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9c5aab1">
<p>
The single-player campaign is surprisingly deep thanks to challenges, some open levels, and plenty of weapons, but the package is rounded out by a great multiplayer mode with AI bots, a rarity at the time.

<h2 id="orgd675b0f">Advance Wars</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd675b0f">
<p>
While surpassed by its sequels, it&rsquo;s still a fantastically accessible tactical game offering a trifecta of a cute campaign, endlessly replayable multiplayer, and &ldquo;war room&rdquo; missions. War has never been this adorable.

<h2 id="org3a1e03e">Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3a1e03e">
<p>
Everything great about <i>Advance Wars</i> turned up. A better and more varied campaign, more COs, more maps, more terrain, and one new unit, the unnecessary Neotank. One of the GBA&rsquo;s greatest.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd725a34">
<p>
It&rsquo;s better balanced than prior games in the series, though the grittiness is just bland and the final mission is brutal and unfun. But the heart of <i>Advance Wars</i> remains, which is what matters most.

<h2 id="orgcfc1927">Advance Wars: Dual Strike</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcfc1927">
<p>
Even more stuff than <i>Black Hole Rising</i>! Sure, the new units are terribly balanced and situational and the new COs aren&rsquo;t great, but everything from before is here. The hard mode campaign is completely broken, but the freedom to choose your COs and abilities means that you&rsquo;re even more busted, allowing for some fun puzzle-y battles where prior strategizing is more important than usual.

The best retro 3D platformer in a while, sure to satisfy fans yearning for something in the <i>Super Mario Sunshine</i> vein. Lives up to its &ldquo;cute as heck&rdquo; billing.

<p>
I put a lot of time into <i>Altitude</i>, a 2D plane combat game, especially &ldquo;ball&rdquo; mode, which was essentially plane rugby/soccer. Pleasing movement and combat with a high skill ceiling and multiple loadouts for depth.

<p>
If it were free, people would still be playing this. Instead, it&rsquo;s a dead game. Drafting was a delight, constructed was pay-to-win, much like Richard Garfield&rsquo;s most famous card game. Made good use of the digital space with its mechanics, and I would have loved to have seen what they had for future card sets. Some very frustrating randomness.

I do not enjoy sitting on benches in a very pretty rendition of the Middle East. Where are all the assassinations? What&rsquo;s with the modern-day segments? (A question I&rsquo;m told is still asked about the other 20ish games.)

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7528204">
<p>
It&rsquo;s a somewhat bizarre hybrid of RTS and shooter. The balance between the two gives a bit of a &ldquo;rubbing your belly while patting your head&rdquo; feel to help conceal the lack of depth of either, and especially the vehicles and aircraft are fun to control. Mission variety is also respectable.

Boy do I wish more games were written at a level that assumes a working knowledge of Objectivism. I&rsquo;m here for the art design, the writing, and the rare ludonarrative concordance in a AAA game; the shooting mechanics are unremarkable by today&rsquo;s standards.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org89ba794">
<p>
How spoiled we were in 2007 to have had this and <i>Halo 3</i> drop within a few weeks of each other. The campaign was unrelenting action, filled with set pieces and levels; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Ghillied_Up">&ldquo;All Ghillied Up&rdquo;</a> has its own Wikipedia page, for crying out loud. The multiplayer took that relentlessness even further with its fast time-to-kill, and it was a masterclass in player engagement. Before the industry switched over to Skinner boxes and pay-to-win monetization, <i>COD4</i> had a constant drip of weapons and challenges, with the hamster wheel prestige system. Everything was done to excite our monkey brains, especially that little crosshair that would come up when hitting an opponent. This was a game that felt <i>good</i> to play.

<p>
Once upon a time, licensed platformers were everywhere, and back in the late 80s and early 90s, many weren&rsquo;t half-bad. <i>Castle of Illusion</i> stands out thanks to its all-over-the-place level themes and enjoyable bounce-based platforming, a core revisited later by games like <i>Shovel Knight</i>.

The original indie labor of love that paved the way for so many others. The tight movement/combat is enough, but it&rsquo;s a charming story and a truly outstanding score (I prefer the original compositions over the remixes, but the graphical updates are an improvement).

While its sense of humor is appreciated and the &ldquo;launch&rdquo; telekinetic power (think Half-Life 2&rsquo;s gravity gun, minus the gun) is a treat, Control&rsquo;s story loses its luster once it becomes obvious that there isn&rsquo;t actually anything grand going on, it&rsquo;s just basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation">SCP Foundation</a> vignettes. Overstays its welcome with the story expansions.

<p>
On the one hand, it&rsquo;s basically a superhuman open world playground with powerful abilities, weapons, and vehicles. On the other, the actual missions suffer when the optimal approach changes from heist-like planning to jumping around, killing everyone, and hiding when your shields wear off. That playground is pretty great, though.

<p>
Arkane took notes on why I was perennially let down by the <i>Dishonored</i> franchise. The timeloop setup, a lack of penalties for killing, bodies disintegrating upon death, and no quicksave option make for a playground that actually encourages the player to take full advantage of its systems and roll with it when it hits the fan. I have plenty of nits to pick, but I was fully hooked for its 20-hour runtime and enjoyed tinkering with my powers and loadout for each mission. Important notes: I played several months after launch, when the AI had been improved, disables online invasions, and turned off objective markers, only using them when stuck.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbd29108">
<p>
A worse version of <i>Dark Souls</i>, especially with the lack of the bonfire system. An egregious incident that stands out is backing away from a dangerous enemy to heal, only to exit lock-on range and have my character turn around and die instantly to a ranged attack I would have blocked with my shield just moments ago. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>Souls</i> games for you!&rdquo; someone on the Internet gleefully exclaims. But with a job and other games to play I find that I, much like Mr. Bond, have no time to die. I&rsquo;ll note that the key difference between this and the other FromSoftware game I bounced off of, <i>Sekiro</i>, is that I made real progress in <i>Demon&rsquo;s Souls</i> and could have beaten it if I wanted to spend the time, but the time lost due to unfair deaths wasn&rsquo;t worth it, while in <i>Sekiro</i> I was incapable of getting any further when I decided very early on that it wasn&rsquo;t for me.

<p>
I want to love it for the imaginative level design and powers, but the game doesn&rsquo;t want me to love it. There are two main issues. First, most of the game&rsquo;s powers are novel ways to kill, but the game&rsquo;s morality system will tell you how awful you are if you avail yourself of them. Second, the mana system encourages the player to use their powers sparingly. (Incentives matter, people.) The result was crouching through the world, teleporting, waiting for the mana to recharge from that teleport, and repeating, quickloading whenever I was caught. This is a boring, slow way to play that the game encourages, rather than playing up its strengths.

Suffers very hard from a need to be bigger than its predecessor. Too many interconnecting systems and actions create an overwhelming game with exactly one way to play. I had a much better time dropping the difficulty from Ultra-Violence to Hurt Me Plenty and ignoring much of it. And why is there so much platforming in a game about murdering demons as ruthlessly as possible?

For the first few areas, this was my favorite open world experience since <i>BOTW</i>. Everything is appropriate for your level and there are all sorts of new discoveries and fun rewards to be found. Unfortunately, balance and fun go out the window in the mid-late game, and this is a very long game. Summons and enormously variable player levels towards the end mean that enemies are rarely of an appropriate difficulty, either getting steamrolled or killing you with a few quick hits. Quality of life problems like the interface, controls, inability to pause, and a 60 FPS cap are completely unacceptable at this point. Ultimately, the <i>BOTW</i>-meets-<i>Dark Souls</i> idea is better on paper than in practice, and I wish this were a much tighter package.

I am unsurprised that a handheld touch-based rhythm game with a nonsensical comic book story about secret agent cheerleaders helping everyday people score dates, defeat monsters, and save Christmas set to a licensed soundtrack of covers sold so poorly. But for those who enjoy the camp, it&rsquo;s a fun rhythm novelty. The spinners destroyed my DS&rsquo; touch screen.

My introduction to the series, and still my favorite. A genuinely engaging story that stands on its own while setting up its sequel. Varied level design as well. Unit balance is poor, with Laguz being useless and paladins being grossly overpowered, and enemy phases are much too slow. But it&rsquo;s the writing that sets it apart. Characters all get time to exist as more than a set of stats with an equipped weapon, and the localization team actually made a character speak in iambic pentameter, which is a pretty bonkers amount of effort.

10 hours in and I was ready to award it 5/5 as a fantastically executed Metroidvania/Soulslike hybrid with superb controls and presentation. 8.5 hours later, having settled for the bad ending, I can&rsquo;t. I have patience for certain difficult games, such as <i>Celeste</i> and <i>Super Meat Boy</i>, but those games almost universally feature instant retries without penalty. <i>Hollow Knight</i> is an absolute slog towards the end, not necessarily due to the difficulty of any of its mandatory bosses (I don&rsquo;t think I died more than thrice on anything required), but because of the amount of downtime. Fast travel is limited, and this led to many situations of fast traveling, walking a minute to the bank, walking back, fast traveling somewhere else, buying something, walking to another vendor, finding out I needed more geo, going back to the bank&#x2026; Or the situations where I die to a boss and have to redo trivial (but slow!) platforming challenges and basic baddies to get back to the boss only to die again. Or my personal favorite, the optional <i>Super Meat Boy</i> spinning saws platformer area where your health is supposed to be a scary limitation for the platforming gauntlet, but I had equipped the charm where your last pip of damage slowly recovers, and so every death meant 30 seconds of looking at my phone instead of playing the game. These are fundamental design problems, and they&rsquo;re frustratingly solvable. Upon discovery that the good ending was locked behind a super boss that requires beating the normal final boss prior to every attempt, I completely lost interest. Which is a shame, because there&rsquo;s a phenomenal game in here.

Almost pure tactics, with just enough management/strategy between to make it interesting. Minor failures, like taking just one point of damage on an island and missing the bonus, don&rsquo;t feel good, and it&rsquo;s not always clear what you could have done better. Really wants an expansion like <i>FTL</i> to give it more variety, but will probably never get one.

As a card game in the <i>Slay the Spire</i> mold, it&rsquo;s enjoyable, but the actually card battling is very narrow tactically, with most of the fun coming from finding ways to create overpowered cards, which is deliberately encouraged by the game. As a fourth wall-breaking subversive indie horror game, nothing felt particularly novel, and I might well have enjoyed the game more if it just wanted to be another roguelike deckbuilder.

Hypothetically hits a lot of my favorite notes as a difficult 2D platformer with short levels and instant retries. It falls short in how it handles its difficulty.

This required driving out to a GameStop for a disappointingly expensive <i>Black</i> and borrowing another DS to facilitate transferring Pokémon from generation IV (some of whom had already come from III!) into VI. And it was fantastic in a compulsive, completionist sort of way. ORAS are bright and joyful, if somewhat pedestrian for the series, but generation VI was also an impressive culmination of catch &rsquo;em all ethos thanks to the many transfer and trade mechanisms.

<i>RDR2</i> is stunning. The scope is massive, making its obsessive details even more gratuitous. The sheer number of systems in the game make it feel almost like an immersive sim at times with a consistent internal logic, and I can point to any number of moments where they all came together for an experience few other open world games are capable of. The problem, then, is that there&rsquo;s barely a game in there, which really hurts over the course of a 50+ hour story. This is a Rockstar game, and most missions boil down to riding your horse somewhere or shooting comically large numbers of people, with entirely too many actions reduced to button prompts on a frustratingly inconsistent control scheme. At times, this feels like the world&rsquo;s most overproduced animated cowboy show. I won&rsquo;t say it doesn&rsquo;t respect the player&rsquo;s time, but it has a vision that results in very large amounts of downtime for the player. Nevertheless, the core systems of <i>RDR2</i> are incredible, and especially when it gets out of its own way enough for the player to hunt down a perfect animal or make a clean robbery, it&rsquo;s one of the most fully realized digital worlds in gaming history. As an aside, Rockstar&rsquo;s DRM is awful, and on multiple occasions I&rsquo;ve gone through the multi-minute song and dance of launching the game only to be told falsely that my account is not allowed to play. That plus the plodding pace make for a very high fixed cost to a play session.

Where <i>ICO</i> fails as a game, <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> makes some concessions to its vision (look, a HUD!) to more than make up for it with this classic.

Of all the usual &ldquo;games as art&rdquo; suspects, <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> is perhaps the strongest on the gameplay front.

At some point, Valve described it as &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s #1 war-themed hat simulator,&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s a little on the nose. The sum of the new content detracts from the rock-paper-scissors of the base game, even though some of the class updates, like for the Medic and Pyro, made them more interesting and fun to play.

My favorite roguelike on the strength of its variety of content, in spite of its complete indifference towards fairness or balance and distasteful themes. The various expansions have only added to the sheer amount of stuff, but the many new paths and bosses bloat the game somewhat, and 60+ minute runs completely overstay their welcome.

I was going to make a comment about the story hurting my head, but I suppose the combat does that just a little more, at least in the original DS version. Like most JRPGs, the lack of interplay between the gameplay and the story hurts it (why isn&rsquo;t this just a comic?), but they&rsquo;re both individually sound.

It takes <i>Enemy Unknown</i>, improves the good parts, and strips out as much of the boring strategic layer as it can. My favorite turn-based tactics game of all time. Huge replayability thanks to the randomized levels, soldiers, and enemies (the latter in the <i>War of the Chosen</i> expansion, which is vital). I live for those turns where the game becomes a challenge to somehow kill all the enemies, or even just survive, and it delivers in spades. Main weakness is the reverse difficulty curve.
