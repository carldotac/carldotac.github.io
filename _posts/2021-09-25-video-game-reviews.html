<h2 id="org5440de6">007: Nightfire</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5440de6">
<p>
The single-player campaign is surprisingly deep thanks to challenges, some open levels, and plenty of weapons, but the package is rounded out by a great multiplayer mode with AI bots, a rarity at the time.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgec52538">
<p>
The best-told narrative I&rsquo;ve ever seen in a game. Gripping for all 30+ hours, and had me constantly thinking about how all its pieces fit together. Superb localization and art.

<h2 id="org038638a">Advance Wars</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org038638a">
<p>
While surpassed by its sequels, it&rsquo;s still a fantastically accessible tactical game offering a trifecta of a cute campaign, endlessly replayable multiplayer, and &ldquo;war room&rdquo; missions. War has never been this adorable.

<h2 id="org80a3c1c">Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org80a3c1c">
<p>
Everything great about <i>Advance Wars</i> turned up. A better and more varied campaign, more COs, more maps, more terrain, and one new unit, the unnecessary Neotank. One of the GBA&rsquo;s greatest.

<h2 id="orgfc1c893">Advance Wars: Days of Ruin</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfc1c893">
<p>
It&rsquo;s better balanced than prior games in the series, though the grittiness is just bland and the final mission is brutal and unfun. But the heart of <i>Advance Wars</i> remains, which is what matters most.

<h2 id="orgea2d09c">Advance Wars: Dual Strike</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgea2d09c">
<p>
Even more stuff than <i>Black Hole Rising</i>! Sure, the new units are terribly balanced and situational and the new COs aren&rsquo;t great, but everything from before is here. The hard mode campaign is completely broken, but the freedom to choose your COs and abilities means that you&rsquo;re even more busted, allowing for some fun puzzle-y battles where prior strategizing is more important than usual.

The best retro 3D platformer in a while, sure to satisfy fans yearning for something in the <i>Super Mario Sunshine</i> vein. Lives up to its &ldquo;cute as heck&rdquo; billing.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org121d7a2">
<p>
I put a lot of time into <i>Altitude</i>, a 2D plane combat game, especially &ldquo;ball&rdquo; mode, which was essentially plane rugby/soccer. Pleasing movement and combat with a high skill ceiling and multiple loadouts for depth.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4e08c41">
<p>
If it were free, people would still be playing this. Instead, it&rsquo;s a dead game. Drafting was a delight, constructed was pay-to-win, much like Richard Garfield&rsquo;s most famous card game. Made good use of the digital space with its mechanics, and I would have loved to have seen what they had for future card sets. Some very frustrating randomness.

<p>
I do not enjoy sitting on benches in a very pretty rendition of the Middle East. Where are all the assassinations? What&rsquo;s with the modern-day segments? (A question I&rsquo;m told is still asked about the other 20ish games.)

<h2 id="orgeaabafb">Astral Chain</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgeaabafb">
<p>
The combat isn&rsquo;t deep enough to hold interest. But even though it&rsquo;s still the best part of the game, it&rsquo;s surrounded by entirely too much padding and time-wasting, and the highest difficulty allowed on a first playthrough is boringly easy except for the final boss&rsquo; difficulty spike, ignorable with all the revive items you never used. Silent protagonist was a bad choice.

<p>
The gameplay is fine, but basic. A narrative that isn&rsquo;t all that interesting is held back by being told through voiceovers while you&rsquo;re in the middle of trying not to die. Great soundtrack. A game that crawled so that <i>Hades</i> could run.

<h2 id="orgdb7eaa5">Battalion Wars</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdb7eaa5">
<p>
It&rsquo;s a somewhat bizarre hybrid of RTS and shooter. The balance between the two gives a bit of a &ldquo;rubbing your belly while patting your head&rdquo; feel to help conceal the lack of depth of either, and especially the vehicles and aircraft are fun to control. Mission variety is also respectable.

Boy do I wish more games were written at a level that assumes a working knowledge of Objectivism. I&rsquo;m here for the art design, the writing, and the rare ludonarrative concordance in a AAA game; the shooting mechanics are unremarkable by today&rsquo;s standards.

Very obviously made without Ken Levine. And without an auteur, it&rsquo;s just another mechanically competent bland shooter with nothing to say. I did like the Minerva&rsquo;s Den DLC, whose story is interesting enough to carry its few hours.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd1f1d4c">
<p>
As an experiment in the <i>Mario</i> formula, it&rsquo;s a failure: the Bowser interruptions are annoying, having objectives that can only be done during these infrequent, uncontrollable segments is unusually hostile to the player, and the open world doesn&rsquo;t really add anything to what is, at its heart, a series of disconnected <i>64</i>-style vignettes. And those levels and platforming are fun, but there&rsquo;s nothing new there.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4cfa2d3">
<p>
How spoiled we were in 2007 to have had this and <i>Halo 3</i> drop within a few weeks of each other. The campaign was unrelenting action, filled with set pieces and levels; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Ghillied_Up">&ldquo;All Ghillied Up&rdquo;</a> has its own Wikipedia page, for crying out loud. The multiplayer took that relentlessness even further with its fast time-to-kill, and it was a masterclass in player engagement. Before the industry switched over to Skinner boxes and pay-to-win monetization, <i>COD4</i> had a constant drip of weapons and challenges, with the hamster wheel prestige system. Everything was done to excite our monkey brains, especially that little crosshair that would come up when hitting an opponent. This was a game that felt <i>good</i> to play.

Once upon a time, licensed platformers were everywhere, and back in the late 80s and early 90s, many weren&rsquo;t half-bad. <i>Castle of Illusion</i> stands out thanks to its all-over-the-place level themes and enjoyable bounce-based platforming, a core revisited later by games like <i>Shovel Knight</i>.

<p>
There&rsquo;s the devious puzzle game half, with many a fist pump after a completed level. But this is Atlus, so there&rsquo;s also a fascinating and messy dating simulator half. I love many of the mature themes of love and adulthood, the art design, and Shoji Meguro&rsquo;s score filled with classical-inspired pieces. Certain aspects of the characters and their relationships are lacking, the LGBT themes are, at my most charitable, clumsily handled, and the final act(s) can go off the rails in terms of narrative and tone. Still, this is a crafted experience, and something I want to see more of in the medium.

The original indie labor of love that paved the way for so many others. The tight movement/combat is enough, but it&rsquo;s a charming story and a truly outstanding score (I prefer the original compositions over the remixes, but the graphical updates are an improvement).

While its sense of humor is appreciated and the &ldquo;launch&rdquo; telekinetic power (think Half-Life 2&rsquo;s gravity gun, minus the gun) is a treat, Control&rsquo;s story loses its luster once it becomes obvious that there isn&rsquo;t actually anything grand going on, it&rsquo;s just basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation">SCP Foundation</a> vignettes.

On the one hand, it&rsquo;s basically a superhuman open world playground with powerful abilities, weapons, and vehicles.

That playground is pretty great, though.

<p>
Arkane took notes on why I was perennially let down by the <i>Dishonored</i> franchise. The timeloop setup, a lack of penalties for killing, bodies disintegrating upon death, and no quicksave option make for a playground that actually encourages the player to take full advantage of its systems and roll with it when it hits the fan. I have plenty of nits to pick, but I was fully hooked for its 20-hour runtime and enjoyed tinkering with my powers and loadout for each mission. Important notes: I played several months after launch, when the AI had been improved, disables online invasions, and turned off objective markers, only using them when stuck.

<p>
A worse version of <i>Dark Souls</i>, especially with the lack of the bonfire system. An egregious incident that stands out is backing away from a dangerous enemy to heal, only to exit lock-on range and have my character turn around and die instantly to a ranged attack I would have blocked with my shield just moments ago. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>Souls</i> games for you!&rdquo; someone on the Internet gleefully exclaims. But with a job and other games to play I find that I, much like Mr. Bond, have no time to die. I&rsquo;ll note that the key difference between this and the other FromSoftware game I bounced off of, <i>Sekiro</i>, is that I made real progress in <i>Demon&rsquo;s Souls</i> and could have beaten it if I wanted to spend the time, but the time lost due to unfair deaths wasn&rsquo;t worth it, while in <i>Sekiro</i> I was incapable of getting any further when I decided very early on that it wasn&rsquo;t for me.

I want to love it for the imaginative level design and powers, but the game doesn&rsquo;t want me to love it. There are two main issues. First, most of the game&rsquo;s powers are novel ways to kill, but the game&rsquo;s morality system will tell you how awful you are if you avail yourself of them. Second, the mana system encourages the player to use their powers sparingly. (Incentives matter, people.) The result was crouching through the world, teleporting, waiting for the mana to recharge from that teleport, and repeating, quickloading whenever I was caught. This is a boring, slow way to play that the game encourages, rather than playing up its strengths.

For the first few areas, this was my favorite open world experience since <i>BOTW</i>. Everything is appropriate for your level and there are all sorts of new discoveries and fun rewards to be found. Unfortunately, balance and fun go out the window in the mid-late game, and this is a very long game. Summons and enormously variable player levels towards the end mean that enemies are rarely of an appropriate difficulty, either getting steamrolled or killing you with a few quick hits. Quality of life problems like the interface, controls, inability to pause, and a 60 FPS cap are completely unacceptable at this point. Ultimately, the <i>BOTW</i>-meets-<i>Dark Souls</i> idea is better on paper than in practice, and I wish this were a much tighter package.

My introduction to the series, and still my favorite. A genuinely engaging story that stands on its own while setting up its sequel. Varied level design as well.

Beautifully woven story/gameplay interaction. While a great game, it&rsquo;s a roguelike for people who don&rsquo;t like roguelikes. And as a fan of the genre, it lacks the staying power of something like The Binding of Isaac. Would love to see an expansion to add some replayability, and the difficulty progression really could have benefited from allowing rewards for increasing the level by more than 1 at a time. I&rsquo;m nitpicking because I love it.

A masterpiece. With better lighting and lip syncing, this could come out today and still be well received.

<p>
10 hours in and I was ready to award it 5/5 as a fantastically executed Metroidvania/Soulslike hybrid with superb controls and presentation. 8.5 hours later, having settled for the bad ending, I can&rsquo;t. I have patience for certain difficult games, such as <i>Celeste</i> and <i>Super Meat Boy</i>, but those games almost universally feature instant retries without penalty. <i>Hollow Knight</i> is an absolute slog towards the end, not necessarily due to the difficulty of any of its mandatory bosses (I don&rsquo;t think I died more than thrice on anything required), but because of the amount of downtime. Fast travel is limited, and this led to many situations of fast traveling, walking a minute to the bank, walking back, fast traveling somewhere else, buying something, walking to another vendor, finding out I needed more geo, going back to the bank&#x2026; Or the situations where I die to a boss and have to redo trivial (but slow!) platforming challenges and basic baddies to get back to the boss only to die again. Or my personal favorite, the optional <i>Super Meat Boy</i> spinning saws platformer area where your health is supposed to be a scary limitation for the platforming gauntlet, but I had equipped the charm where your last pip of damage slowly recovers, and so every death meant 30 seconds of looking at my phone instead of playing the game. These are fundamental design problems, and they&rsquo;re frustratingly solvable. Upon discovery that the good ending was locked behind a super boss that requires beating the normal final boss prior to every attempt, I completely lost interest. Which is a shame, because there&rsquo;s a phenomenal game in here.

Starts off with a thoughtful premise and gameplay that teases a combination of <i>Breath of the Wild</i> and <i>Monster Hunter</i> before mostly settling into a generic modern open-world game with all of the pointless padding, jank, and ill-executed narrative that entails. Shooting robot dinosaurs with a bow is fun, and yet most of your time is spent doing tedious tasks like reading/listening to exposition (both for the impossibly uninteresting contemporary narrative and the more passable sci-fi backstory), holding forward on the developer-ordained correct path through ruins/wreckage/cliffs, fighting boring humans, and manging your inventory. Aloy&rsquo;s characterization is terrible, and how is someone who spent her entire childhood talking to almost no one except for JB Blanc so sarcastic?

Hypothetically hits a lot of my favorite notes as a difficult 2D platformer with short levels and instant retries. It falls short in how it handles its difficulty. Many levels are trivial and only challenging if going for optional gold, but unlike the strawberries and bandages of <i>Celeste</i> and <i>Super Meat Boy</i>, there are often dozens of gold pieces on an individual level, making them a completionist annoyance instead of a one-off challenge. I also prefer the speed of those games over the heavy, momentum-based <i>N++</i>.

It&rsquo;s hard not to judge this one unfairly after playing <i>5</i> and <i>4</i>, especially with the PSP version&rsquo;s almost complete lack of 3D graphics or anime cutscenes stripping the game of so much atmosphere. But then again, the dungeon crawl is pointless padding of no interest or difficulty, the bosses are too easy save for a handful of level checks forcing grinding, the story seems to forget to do anything for entire in-game months at a time, and few of the songs can touch the OSTs from <i>4</i> or <i>5</i>.

The best JRPG I have ever played (though as of this writing, also the only <i>Persona</i> game I&rsquo;ve played).

Each enhances the other (I&rsquo;ve strengthened a bond with this friend and now they have this ability; I&rsquo;ve completed a palace and now can hang out with this friend and can now hang out with them) in a way that, coupled with the aforementioned plot and presentation, manages to hold up over its very long runtime.

Stressed during my senior year of college, I decided that I&rsquo;d try to complete the National Pokédex in <i>Omega Ruby</i>.

This required driving out to a GameStop for a disappointingly expensive <i>Black</i> and borrowing another DS to facilitate transferring Pokémon from generation IV (some of whom had already come from III!) into VI. And it was fantastic in a compulsive, completionist sort of way. ORAS are bright and joyful, if somewhat pedestrian for the series, but generation VI was also an impressive culmination of catch &rsquo;em all ethos thanks to the many transfer and trade mechanisms.

<i>RDR2</i> is stunning. The scope is massive, making its obsessive details even more gratuitous. The sheer number of systems in the game make it feel almost like an immersive sim at times with a consistent internal logic, and I can point to any number of moments where they all came together for an experience few other open world games are capable of. The problem, then, is that there&rsquo;s barely a game in there, which really hurts over the course of a 50+ hour story. This is a Rockstar game, and most missions boil down to riding your horse somewhere or shooting comically large numbers of people, with entirely too many actions reduced to button prompts on a frustratingly inconsistent control scheme. At times, this feels like the world&rsquo;s most overproduced animated cowboy show. I won&rsquo;t say it doesn&rsquo;t respect the player&rsquo;s time, but it has a vision that results in very large amounts of downtime for the player. Nevertheless, the core systems of <i>RDR2</i> are incredible, and especially when it gets out of its own way enough for the player to hunt down a perfect animal or make a clean robbery, it&rsquo;s one of the most fully realized digital worlds in gaming history. As an aside, Rockstar&rsquo;s DRM is awful, and on multiple occasions I&rsquo;ve gone through the multi-minute song and dance of launching the game only to be told falsely that my account is not allowed to play. That plus the plodding pace make for a very high fixed cost to a play session.

The platonic ideal Sonic game, with delightful throwback graphics and soundtrack with top-notch level design. Unfortunately, the Sonic formula is fundamentally flawed.

I can recognize <i>Super Metroid</i> as a genre-defining game.

The controls are terrible and Samus&rsquo; movement is slow and clunky. What it gets right are a constant sense of progression and its atmosphere, especially <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9ieYLHc1fQ">the music</a>.

I was going to make a comment about the story hurting my head, but I suppose the combat does that just a little more, at least in the original DS version. Like most JRPGs, the lack of interplay between the gameplay and the story hurts it (why isn&rsquo;t this just a comic?), but they&rsquo;re both individually sound.

The brilliance is in the in-game manual, with its mysteries and layers.

I want to love this for its unique take on the tactical genre, and there are some ideas in there that deserve it. But it is too often a janky, opaque mess that deprives players of vital information, encouraging save scumming and forcing reloads when the developers pull the rug out from under the player. Spends a lot of time answering the question &ldquo;What if World War II, but anime,&rdquo; resulting in a thematically unholy combination of concentration camps, comic relief winged pigs, clumsy nuclear metaphors, and the female lead wearing an anachronistic bikini.

Despite a better story and a few fun tweaks and additions over the original, it retains every single problem from it.

The emphasis on positioning your allies each turn makes it heavily tactical.

It takes <i>Enemy Unknown</i>, improves the good parts, and strips out as much of the boring strategic layer as it can. My favorite turn-based tactics game of all time. Huge replayability thanks to the randomized levels, soldiers, and enemies (the latter in the <i>War of the Chosen</i> expansion, which is vital). I live for those turns where the game becomes a challenge to somehow kill all the enemies, or even just survive, and it delivers in spades. Main weakness is the reverse difficulty curve.
