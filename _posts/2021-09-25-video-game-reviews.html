<h2 id="orgc2811d9">007: Nightfire</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc2811d9">
<p>
The single-player campaign is surprisingly deep thanks to challenges, some open levels, and plenty of weapons, but the package is rounded out by a great multiplayer mode with AI bots, a rarity at the time.

<h2 id="org9891002">13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9891002">
<p>
The best-told narrative I&rsquo;ve ever seen in a game. Gripping for all 30+ hours, and had me constantly thinking about how all its pieces fit together. Superb localization and art.

<h2 id="org5afd15f">Advance Wars</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5afd15f">
<p>
While surpassed by its sequels, it&rsquo;s still a fantastically accessible tactical game offering a trifecta of a cute campaign, endlessly replayable multiplayer, and &ldquo;war room&rdquo; missions. War has never been this adorable.

<h2 id="org6c61dc1">Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6c61dc1">
<p>
Everything great about <i>Advance Wars</i> turned up. A better and more varied campaign, more COs, more maps, more terrain, and one new unit, the unnecessary Neotank. One of the GBA&rsquo;s greatest.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org09c7ab4">
<p>
It&rsquo;s better balanced than prior games in the series, though the grittiness is just bland and the final mission is brutal and unfun. But the heart of <i>Advance Wars</i> remains, which is what matters most.

<h2 id="org11e84ae">Advance Wars: Dual Strike</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org11e84ae">
<p>
Even more stuff than <i>Black Hole Rising</i>! Sure, the new units are terribly balanced and situational and the new COs aren&rsquo;t great, but everything from before is here. The hard mode campaign is completely broken, but the freedom to choose your COs and abilities means that you&rsquo;re even more busted, allowing for some fun puzzle-y battles where prior strategizing is more important than usual.

The best retro 3D platformer in a while, sure to satisfy fans yearning for something in the <i>Super Mario Sunshine</i> vein. Lives up to its &ldquo;cute as heck&rdquo; billing.

<p>
I put a lot of time into <i>Altitude</i>, a 2D plane combat game, especially &ldquo;ball&rdquo; mode, which was essentially plane rugby/soccer. Pleasing movement and combat with a high skill ceiling and multiple loadouts for depth.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6e487ab">
<p>
If it were free, people would still be playing this. Instead, it&rsquo;s a dead game. Drafting was a delight, constructed was pay-to-win, much like Richard Garfield&rsquo;s most famous card game. Made good use of the digital space with its mechanics, and I would have loved to have seen what they had for future card sets. Some very frustrating randomness.

<p>
I do not enjoy sitting on benches in a very pretty rendition of the Middle East. Where are all the assassinations? What&rsquo;s with the modern-day segments? (A question I&rsquo;m told is still asked about the other 20ish games.)

<h2 id="orgbc3258c">Astral Chain</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbc3258c">
<p>
The combat isn&rsquo;t deep enough to hold interest. But even though it&rsquo;s still the best part of the game, it&rsquo;s surrounded by entirely too much padding and time-wasting, and the highest difficulty allowed on a first playthrough is boringly easy except for the final boss&rsquo; difficulty spike, ignorable with all the revive items you never used. Silent protagonist was a bad choice.

Long after its captivating first impression, <i>Balatro</i> maintains the edge-of-your-seat anticipation of what its next hand might contain.
Unusual for me, I like this better than most other turn-based roguelikes despite the emphasis on strategy over tactics.

<p>
The gameplay is fine, but basic. A narrative that isn&rsquo;t all that interesting is held back by being told through voiceovers while you&rsquo;re in the middle of trying not to die. Great soundtrack. A game that crawled so that <i>Hades</i> could run.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb0a9d31">
<p>
It&rsquo;s a somewhat bizarre hybrid of RTS and shooter. The balance between the two gives a bit of a &ldquo;rubbing your belly while patting your head&rdquo; feel to help conceal the lack of depth of either, and especially the vehicles and aircraft are fun to control. Mission variety is also respectable.

Boy do I wish more games were written at a level that assumes a working knowledge of Objectivism. I&rsquo;m here for the art design, the writing, and the rare ludonarrative concordance in a AAA game; the shooting mechanics are unremarkable by today&rsquo;s standards.

As an experiment in the <i>Mario</i> formula, it&rsquo;s a failure: the Bowser interruptions are annoying, having objectives that can only be done during these infrequent, uncontrollable segments is unusually hostile to the player, and the open world doesn&rsquo;t really add anything to what is, at its heart, a series of disconnected <i>64</i>-style vignettes. And those levels and platforming are fun, but there&rsquo;s nothing new there.

How spoiled we were in 2007 to have had this and <i>Halo 3</i> drop within a few weeks of each other. The campaign was unrelenting action, filled with set pieces and levels; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Ghillied_Up">&ldquo;All Ghillied Up&rdquo;</a> has its own Wikipedia page, for crying out loud. The multiplayer took that relentlessness even further with its fast time-to-kill, and it was a masterclass in player engagement. Before the industry switched over to Skinner boxes and pay-to-win monetization, <i>COD4</i> had a constant drip of weapons and challenges, with the hamster wheel prestige system. Everything was done to excite our monkey brains, especially that little crosshair that would come up when hitting an opponent. This was a game that felt <i>good</i> to play.

Once upon a time, licensed platformers were everywhere, and back in the late 80s and early 90s, many weren&rsquo;t half-bad. <i>Castle of Illusion</i> stands out thanks to its all-over-the-place level themes and enjoyable bounce-based platforming, a core revisited later by games like <i>Shovel Knight</i>.

<p>
There&rsquo;s the devious puzzle game half, with many a fist pump after a completed level. But this is Atlus, so there&rsquo;s also a fascinating and messy dating simulator half. I love many of the mature themes of love and adulthood, the art design, and Shoji Meguro&rsquo;s score filled with classical-inspired pieces. Certain aspects of the characters and their relationships are lacking, the LGBT themes are, at my most charitable, clumsily handled, and the final act(s) can go off the rails in terms of narrative and tone. Still, this is a crafted experience, and something I want to see more of in the medium.

On the one hand, it&rsquo;s basically a superhuman open world playground with powerful abilities, weapons, and vehicles.

Arkane took notes on why I was perennially let down by the <i>Dishonored</i> franchise. The timeloop setup, a lack of penalties for killing, bodies disintegrating upon death, and no quicksave option make for a playground that actually encourages the player to take full advantage of its systems and roll with it when it hits the fan. I have plenty of nits to pick, but I was fully hooked for its 20-hour runtime and enjoyed tinkering with my powers and loadout for each mission. Important notes: I played several months after launch, when the AI had been improved, disables online invasions, and turned off objective markers, only using them when stuck.

<p>
A worse version of <i>Dark Souls</i>, especially with the lack of the bonfire system. An egregious incident that stands out is backing away from a dangerous enemy to heal, only to exit lock-on range and have my character turn around and die instantly to a ranged attack I would have blocked with my shield just moments ago. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>Souls</i> games for you!&rdquo; someone on the Internet gleefully exclaims. But with a job and other games to play I find that I, much like Mr. Bond, have no time to die. I&rsquo;ll note that the key difference between this and the other FromSoftware game I bounced off of, <i>Sekiro</i>, is that I made real progress in <i>Demon&rsquo;s Souls</i> and could have beaten it if I wanted to spend the time, but the time lost due to unfair deaths wasn&rsquo;t worth it, while in <i>Sekiro</i> I was incapable of getting any further when I decided very early on that it wasn&rsquo;t for me.

I want to love it for the imaginative level design and powers, but the game doesn&rsquo;t want me to love it. There are two main issues. First, most of the game&rsquo;s powers are novel ways to kill, but the game&rsquo;s morality system will tell you how awful you are if you avail yourself of them. Second, the mana system encourages the player to use their powers sparingly. (Incentives matter, people.) The result was crouching through the world, teleporting, waiting for the mana to recharge from that teleport, and repeating, quickloading whenever I was caught. This is a boring, slow way to play that the game encourages, rather than playing up its strengths.

For the first few areas, this was my favorite open world experience since <i>BOTW</i>. Everything is appropriate for your level and there are all sorts of new discoveries and fun rewards to be found. Unfortunately, balance and fun go out the window in the mid-late game, and this is a very long game. Summons and enormously variable player levels towards the end mean that enemies are rarely of an appropriate difficulty, either getting steamrolled or killing you with a few quick hits. Quality of life problems like the interface, controls, inability to pause, and a 60 FPS cap are completely unacceptable at this point. Ultimately, the <i>BOTW</i>-meets-<i>Dark Souls</i> idea is better on paper than in practice, and I wish this were a much tighter package.

The highs are high, especially in the excellent closing sequence, but this makes it all the more frustrating that the game suffers from unnecessary padding and pacing issues.

My introduction to the series, and still my favorite. A genuinely engaging story that stands on its own while setting up its sequel. Varied level design as well.

In the series&rsquo; storied mistreatment of women, not enough attention is paid to <i>Chinatown Wars</i> creating a female character so they could put her on the cover, then killing her off immediately.

A stunning technical achievement of the seventh generation of consoles, but not a good game. Some of the missions, especially the heists, are fun, but there aren&rsquo;t enough of them in between the time killers. Trevor is not nearly the social commentary that Rockstar thinks he is. The torture scene was one of the worst experiences I have had in all of gaming, with no artistic merit.

Beautifully woven story/gameplay interaction. While a great game, it&rsquo;s a roguelike for people who don&rsquo;t like roguelikes.

10 hours in and I was ready to award it 5/5 as a fantastically executed Metroidvania/Soulslike hybrid with superb controls and presentation. 8.5 hours later, having settled for the bad ending, I can&rsquo;t. I have patience for certain difficult games, such as <i>Celeste</i> and <i>Super Meat Boy</i>, but those games almost universally feature instant retries without penalty. <i>Hollow Knight</i> is an absolute slog towards the end, not necessarily due to the difficulty of any of its mandatory bosses (I don&rsquo;t think I died more than thrice on anything required), but because of the amount of downtime. Fast travel is limited, and this led to many situations of fast traveling, walking a minute to the bank, walking back, fast traveling somewhere else, buying something, walking to another vendor, finding out I needed more geo, going back to the bank&#x2026; Or the situations where I die to a boss and have to redo trivial (but slow!) platforming challenges and basic baddies to get back to the boss only to die again. Or my personal favorite, the optional <i>Super Meat Boy</i> spinning saws platformer area where your health is supposed to be a scary limitation for the platforming gauntlet, but I had equipped the charm where your last pip of damage slowly recovers, and so every death meant 30 seconds of looking at my phone instead of playing the game. These are fundamental design problems, and they&rsquo;re frustratingly solvable. Upon discovery that the good ending was locked behind a super boss that requires beating the normal final boss prior to every attempt, I completely lost interest. Which is a shame, because there&rsquo;s a phenomenal game in here.

Starts off with a thoughtful premise and gameplay that teases a combination of <i>Breath of the Wild</i> and <i>Monster Hunter</i> before mostly settling into a generic modern open-world game with all of the pointless padding, jank, and ill-executed narrative that entails. Shooting robot dinosaurs with a bow is fun, and yet most of your time is spent doing tedious tasks like reading/listening to exposition (both for the impossibly uninteresting contemporary narrative and the more passable sci-fi backstory), holding forward on the developer-ordained correct path through ruins/wreckage/cliffs, fighting boring humans, and manging your inventory.

Dread? Not really. Annoyance? Yes. The good parts are better than those in <i>Super Metroid</i>, but the terrible semi-stealth (really, speedrunning) EMMI sections, the moments where it&rsquo;s not clear what the game wants you to do, and the surprising linearity are all unforced errors.

<i>Ocarina of Time</i> and <i>Super Mario 64</i> get all the credit for adapting their 2D predecessors for the new 3D-capable world, but <i>Metroid Prime</i> deserves to be discussed with them. A fantastic atmosphere and sense of loneliness as you explore the world. The synth-heavy ambient/industrial OST is fantastic and compeltely unexpected. Falls off slightly towards the end with a few non-obvious artifacts to find and the final two bosses being spongy slogs.

Hypothetically hits a lot of my favorite notes as a difficult 2D platformer with short levels and instant retries. It falls short in how it handles its difficulty. Many levels are trivial and only challenging if going for optional gold, but unlike the strawberries and bandages of <i>Celeste</i> and <i>Super Meat Boy</i>, there are often dozens of gold pieces on an individual level, making them a completionist annoyance instead of a one-off challenge. I also prefer the speed of those games over the heavy, momentum-based <i>N++</i>.

There&rsquo;s a good Metroidvania in here that is <i>completely</i> let down by its awful checkpoint system that makes the frequent deaths massively more frustrating than they need to be.
Coupled with the unclear visual design (I don&rsquo;t mind retrying extended precision platforming segments, but repeatedly dying to not figuring out what the game wants from me is a terrible experience), difficulty spikes, and unexpected deaths, it&rsquo;s hugely disappointing that these annoyances mar the core gameplay.
It&rsquo;s not that <i>Ori</i> is especially hard&#x2013;I have every achievement in <i>Celeste</i>, I unlocked The Kid in <i>Super Meat Boy</i>&#x2013;it&rsquo;s that it infuriated me in a way that they and others do not.

It&rsquo;s hard not to judge this one unfairly after playing <i>5</i> and <i>4</i>, especially with the PSP version&rsquo;s almost complete lack of 3D graphics or anime cutscenes stripping the game of so much atmosphere.

Each enhances the other (I&rsquo;ve strengthened a bond with this friend and now they have this ability; I&rsquo;ve completed a palace and now can hang out with this friend and can now hang out with them) in a way that, coupled with the aforementioned plot and presentation, manages to hold up over its very long runtime.

This required driving out to a GameStop for a disappointingly expensive <i>Black</i> and borrowing another DS to facilitate transferring Pokémon from generation IV (some of whom had already come from III!) into VI. And it was fantastic in a compulsive, completionist sort of way. ORAS are bright and joyful, if somewhat pedestrian for the series, but generation VI was also an impressive culmination of catch &rsquo;em all ethos thanks to the many transfer and trade mechanisms.

<i>RDR2</i> is stunning. The scope is massive, making its obsessive details even more gratuitous. The sheer number of systems in the game make it feel almost like an immersive sim at times with a consistent internal logic, and I can point to any number of moments where they all came together for an experience few other open world games are capable of. The problem, then, is that there&rsquo;s barely a game in there, which really hurts over the course of a 50+ hour story. This is a Rockstar game, and most missions boil down to riding your horse somewhere or shooting comically large numbers of people, with entirely too many actions reduced to button prompts on a frustratingly inconsistent control scheme. At times, this feels like the world&rsquo;s most overproduced animated cowboy show. I won&rsquo;t say it doesn&rsquo;t respect the player&rsquo;s time, but it has a vision that results in very large amounts of downtime for the player. Nevertheless, the core systems of <i>RDR2</i> are incredible, and especially when it gets out of its own way enough for the player to hunt down a perfect animal or make a clean robbery, it&rsquo;s one of the most fully realized digital worlds in gaming history. As an aside, Rockstar&rsquo;s DRM is awful, and on multiple occasions I&rsquo;ve gone through the multi-minute song and dance of launching the game only to be told falsely that my account is not allowed to play. That plus the plodding pace make for a very high fixed cost to a play session.

Where <i>ICO</i> fails as a game, <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i> makes some concessions to its vision (look, a HUD!) to more than make up for it with this classic.

The story mode was oddly high budget, but the slower pace as a concession to the Wii&rsquo;s poor online is too steep a price. Also, tripping? I get what Sakurai wanted to do, but randomly robbing the player of control in a fighting game is just bad design. More than a decade later, I remain upset at the time when my character tripped into the final level of All-Star Mode when I wanted to heal. I did not win.

A direct improvement over <i>Breath of the Wild</i> in many ways, including enemy variety, dungeon design, and interlocking systems to encourage engagement with all of them.
Too often, it mistakes more content with better game design, and more willingness to cut fluff would have been beneficial (dragging Koroks around, propping up signs, one-off gimmicks and minigames) that are uninteresting time wasters.
This would put greater emphasis on the main quests and better side quests, which are all strong; we&rsquo;ve explored this Hyrule before, so the best moments are reveals and discoveries rather than the pure wonder of exploration.
Actually, exploration is often boring or slow, which is a problem because this world is <i>huge</i>.
And while I approve of the game tending to avoid spelling out some information or puzzles, there are surprising rough edges of insufficient or actively misleading explanations and prompts.
But these are nitpicks, and this is a worthy successor to one of the greatest games of all time, if not as groundbreaking.

For my money, the best in the series. The best kind of zany.

It takes <i>Enemy Unknown</i>, improves the good parts, and strips out as much of the boring strategic layer as it can. My favorite turn-based tactics game of all time. Huge replayability thanks to the randomized levels, soldiers, and enemies (the latter in the <i>War of the Chosen</i> expansion, which is vital). I live for those turns where the game becomes a challenge to somehow kill all the enemies, or even just survive, and it delivers in spades. Main weakness is the reverse difficulty curve.

While it loses the depth of <i>XCOM 2</i>, there&rsquo;s some good tactical puzzle action to be had here and the changes to the formula are enough of a novelty for its runtime.

Completely outclassed by <i>XCOM 2</i>, but it was a revelation coming from Fire Emblem to get to play with destructable environments and line of sight. Improved by the <i>Enemy Within</i> expansion&rsquo;s nudges to avoid turtling.

I played this during the first year of my PhD, perhaps the last time I&rsquo;ll be willing to put up with an unnecessarily long JRPG. But the combat system is a treat, the score is one of my favorites, and then I was in the right mindstate for an inconsequential shonen story.

Somewhere in the <i>Saints Row 2</i> or <i>GTA</i> mold, confidently and sloppily mixing a crime drama with the tonal potpourri of its side stories. None of the gameplay is especially deep or exciting, which really makes things drag. Long cutscenes, run to pink dot, fight people isn&rsquo;t a great gameplay loop.

What if we took Banjo-Kazooie and removed the tight level design for vast, barren worlds? The version I played at launch was buggy and had a camera that was downright hostile to the player.
