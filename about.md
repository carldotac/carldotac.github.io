title: About Me
---

My name is Carl Lieberman.
I wear many hats.

### Research

I graduated from Brandeis University with a major in economics and math minor.
My senior thesis, "Aggregated Review Scores and Consumer Demand for Experience Goods: A Case Study in the Motion Picture Industry," looked at whether [Rotten Tomatoes](https://rottentomatoes.com) influences demand for movies.
I have also worked on research relating to bereavement and creativity, eligibility monitoring for Medicaid and CHIP, and alternative working arrangements.
Currently, I work as a senior research specialist in the Industrial Relations Section at Princeton University.

### Computing

From a technical side, just about everything I do runs through [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) for its extensibility and fantastic support for the computational tools of the social scientist.
I do statistical computing in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Stata](http://www.stata.com/), general programming in [Java](http://openjdk.java.net/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/), and write in [org](http://orgmode.org/) and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).
All of my machines run GNU/Linux, and my preferred distro is [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) thanks to its flexibility and balance of new features with stability.

### Personal

I watch a lot of baseball.
I play the guitar badly.
Louis from One Direction once complimented my beard.
