<p>Depending on the task, I will typically code in one of <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, <a href="http://www.stata.com/">Stata</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, or <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">Java</a>.
I use Linux on the desktop, and my preferred distro is <a href="https://www.opensuse.org/">openSUSE</a>.
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> is the glue that holds everything together.

<p>I watch a lot of baseball.
I play the guitar badly.
Louis from One Direction once complimented my beard.</p>
