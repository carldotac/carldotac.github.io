<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
<p>I am a PhD student in economics at Princeton University with interests in labor, public, and behavioral economics.
I have worked on topics such as the link between bereavement and creativity, alternative work arrangement valuations, and limited attention in the movie market.
I completed my undergraduate studies at Brandeis University and have previously worked as a senior research specialist in the Industrial Relations Section at Princeton.</p>

<h3 id="computing">Computing</h3>

<p>From a technical side, just about everything I do runs through <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>.
I do statistical computing in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and <a href="http://www.stata.com/">Stata</a>, general programming in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">Java</a>, and write in <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org</a> and <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>.
I use GNU/Linux on the desktop, and my preferred distro is <a href="https://www.opensuse.org/">openSUSE</a> for its flexibility and engineering.</p>

<p>I watch a lot of baseball.
I play the guitar badly.
Louis from One Direction once complimented my beard.</p>
